# Data Privacy & Storage

## Local-Only Data Storage

Cerebral stores **ALL data locally** on your device. We are committed to protecting your privacy:

### ✅ What We DO:
- Store all your data in a local SQLite database (`cerebral.db`)
- Keep all files on your device only
- Never upload or sync data to any cloud service
- Never transmit your data over the internet
- Never collect analytics or telemetry
- All data stays on YOUR computer

### ❌ What We DON'T DO:
- No cloud storage
- No data transmission to external servers
- No tracking or analytics
- No third-party data sharing
- No automatic backups to cloud services
- No account creation or authentication required

### 📍 Where Your Data Lives:
Your data is stored in:
- **Database**: `/Users/[username]/cerebral/src/data/cerebral.db`
- **Preferences**: Browser's localStorage (also local)

### 🔒 Your Data, Your Control:
- All data is stored on your local machine
- You have complete control over your data
- You can backup the `cerebral.db` file yourself if needed
- Deleting the app removes all data from your device
- No data retention on external servers (because we don't use any!)

### 💾 Manual Backup (Recommended):
To backup your data:
1. Locate: `/Users/[username]/cerebral/src/data/cerebral.db`

3. Your preferences are stored in browser localStorage

### 🔐 Security:
